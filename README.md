# just_dorkin
Just me goofing off and searching. I found a repository by @yuraloginoff and i forked it. Unfortunatily, and likely my fault, when i would try to sync the fork it took over 30 min and that just wasnt going to cut it. so i have created a seperate version here and noting them as the person whos work i started with.  Thank you for the work if you ever bump into me.

> noting exciting just a dork maker.
